## Preliminary Stuff:

First things first:  this project requires quite a bit of dependencies.  I don't think any of it is TOO bad (nothing more than pip installing and a couple of more in depth packages), but most of it should be straight forward.  The following list are essentials:

  - numpy
  - pandas
  - pyplot
  - theano
  - keras
  
Next, consider that the project is in 'rapid' development, and will be updated and modified a whole bunch.  Since none of the individual files are far from complete, there is going to be a lot of hoping around.  You're just going to have to deal with it and commit accordingly.

Finally, understand that the scope of the project is very large.  I'm looking at something on the lines of commercial use, so don't expect portions of it to be straight forward.  The math is far from trivial, and the concepts involved can be daunting (but, frankly, intuitve).  You're gonna have to understand the basic algorithm for training neural networks for any of this to make sense.  But it's not too bad.
